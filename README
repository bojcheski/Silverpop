This is an implementation of the Silverpop API for PHP.

I have created two classes, the Silverpop class and the SilverpopWrapper class.

The Silverpop class is a simpler way of executing API calls, but lacks some of the more advanced functionality like some of the optional flags/features of different API calls.

The SilverpopWrapper class can be used to channel any request to the Silverpop API.

See example files for more info.
